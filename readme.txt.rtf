\f0\fs24 \cf0 This repository is my first real foray into using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make a web application.  The app itself is a bit silly; it is a program to analyze the types of a given team from the \'93Pokemon\'94 series of video games and output information about the team\'92s strengths and weaknesses.  \
\
For those familiar with the game, this app is fairly straightforward to understand, but I\'92ll give a brief explination for those who haven\'92t played the game.  \'93Pokemon\'94 games feature a turn based battle system in which players control monsters which battle each other.  The attacks that the monsters use each have a type, and the monsters themselves have either one or two types.  Certain attack types will be either be neutral (x1 damage), \'93Super Effective\'94 (x2 damage), \'93Not Very Effective\'94 (x.5 damage), or completely ineffective (x0 damage) against certain types of monsters.  In making a team of six monsters for competitive play, keeping track of how all possible attack types will impact your team can be quite the task.  Thus the type analysis chart helps keep track of a team\'92s strengths of weaknesses.}
